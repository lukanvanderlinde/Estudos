    <p>
      My first day of the trip! I can't belive I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Becouse I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
      <ul>
        <li>Cell phone.</li>
        <li>iPod.</li>
        <li>Digital camera.</li>
        <li>Protein bar.</li>
      </ul>
      Just the essentials.<br>
      As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q>.
